In this example, we are plotting the twist from two solutions (one from DER and the other one from an "exact" solution). 
Simply run GenerateFig_ch1_helixTerminalMoment.m. The exact solution is contained in "kirchoffrodexact.mat". It can be generated using RodUnderMoment.m.
You can generate the datafile "ch1_helixTerminalMomentData.txt" by running problem 2 of the DER code (located in DER_C++, also read DER_Book_2018/README_MAIN.txt for instructions).
