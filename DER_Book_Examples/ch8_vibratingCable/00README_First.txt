Run GenerateFigure_ch8_configuration.m in MATLAB to generate a figure containing the deformed shape of the rod.
Run GenerateFigure_ch8_energy.m in MATLAB to generate a figure containing the energies of the rod.

The files in the "datafilesEnergy" and "datafilesConfiguration" folder can be generated by running problem 4 of the DER code (located in DER_C++, also read DER_Book_2018/README_MAIN.txt for instructions).
