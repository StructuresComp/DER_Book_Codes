(1) Run GenerateFig_ch1_cantilever.m in MATLAB to generate a figure comparing DER solution and MATLAB bvp4c solution.
MATLAB bvp4c solution is stored in hangingrodtransient.mat.
(2) You can run cantileverBVP.m to generate the bvp4c solution.
(3) The "datafiles/" directory contains the DER solution for three different discretization values: number of vertices = {5, 20, 1000}.
These files can be generated by running problem 1 of the DER code (located in DER_C++, also read DER_Book_2018/README_MAIN.txt for instructions).
